# Installation

We advise to install the package inside a virtual environment (using [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) or [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)). Make sure to create an environment containing a Python version >=3.11 and pip package installer.

After having created and activated your environment, you have two ways for installing ANNUBeS.

## Pip installation

This is the **recommended installation for users**.

```console
pip install annubes
```

This command will install the latest version of the package [deployed on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/annubes/).

## Repository installation

```console
git clone git@github.com:ANNUBS/annubes.git
cd annubes
pip install .
```

The above commands will install the most recent version of the repository, using the default branch (main).
