# Installation

## Repository installation

We advise to install the package inside a virtual environment (using [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) or [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)).

After having created and activated your environment, to install ANNUBeS from GitHub repository, do:

```console
git clone git@github.com:ANNUBS/annubes.git
cd annubes
pip install .
```
